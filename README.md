# 🐾 Pet AI Assistant

**Pet AI Assistant** is a modern, front-end web app for creating detailed dog profiles and generating intelligent food recommendations based on breed, allergies, and pet traits.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project includes breed-based theming, interactive pill-style allergy tags, and localStorage syncing between a form and a recommendation page. It is the first step toward a full-stack smart assistant for dog owners.
