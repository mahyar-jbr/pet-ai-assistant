After spending about a month learning HTML and CSS, I finally took the leap and started building the actual UI for the Pet AI Assistant. I began by translating my Figma sketch into code, using the same color palette — mainly modern shades of blue — to maintain a clean and user-friendly feel.

Seeing the first version of the page come to life felt really good. It reminded me that I just needed to start — even if it’s not perfect. The important thing is to build, and trust that the learning will happen along the way.

I showed the initial version of the form to my friend Mehrad, who has two dogs. He suggested a great idea: changing the theme color of the page based on the selected dog breed. I loved it, and decided to implement it right away.

This was a big moment for me because it meant diving into JavaScript — something I hadn’t really touched before. It took a long time to figure it out, but the process taught me a lot, and in the end, I think it was totally worth it.

I was happy with how the form page turned out, so I moved on to the second page: the pet profile and food recommendation screen. I worked on the UI with the same clean, modern feel as the form, and implemented the same breed-based theming for consistency.

I finished the top profile bar and got the layout started, but I was still unsure about how to design and categorize the food recommendation section. Rather than rush it, I decided to leave that part for another day and give it more thought.

I wasn’t sure how I’d handle the backend or where to get the food data from, since I had no prior experience with that side of development. After talking to two of my graduate student friends, Alireza A. and Alireza P., they reassured me that it’s totally doable. They suggested options like using GPT APIs, web crawling, or even collecting and storing data locally with filtering algorithms for the ingredients. They really liked my idea and encouraged me to keep going.

That conversation gave me a major boost of motivation. I went back to work and focused on syncing the two pages using localStorage in JavaScript, so I could test how pet profiles from the form page would update the profile on the recommendation page. With help from another friend, Arian (also a grad student), I was able to get it working. He also liked the concept and gave positive feedback on the design.

Today felt like a big milestone — I learned a lot, got real features working, and received strong support from people I trust.
